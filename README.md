Action Planner AI is a **multi-agent system powered by GPT-5 + LangChain** that automates the journey from **concept → research → planning → launch-ready assets**.  
It’s like having a **dedicated AI team**:  
- 🕵️ **Researcher** → insights & risks  
- 📋 **Planner** → milestones & workflows  
- ✉️ **Producer** → blogs, landing pages, repos, campaigns  

🌐 **Live Demo**: [Streamlit App](https://action-planner-km8yco87r9q.streamlit.app/)

**🏆 Why Action Planner AI?**

Unlike Jasper, Copy.ai, Perplexity, Webflow AI, or TubeBuddy:

🧩 We unify research, planning, and production in one pipeline.

🔗 Agents collaborate via JSON handoffs.

📦 Outputs are ready-to-publish, not just drafts.

💸 All-in-one → save $100+/month on multiple tools.

💡 Result: Creators, developers, and innovators launch faster.
**
🚧 Roadmap**

 Agent customization (tone/style)

 Third-party publishing integrations (GitHub, YouTube, CMS)

 Multi-language support

 Domain modules (e-commerce, dev workflows, education)

This README now has:  
- ✅ Badges (Streamlit, LangChain, Python, License)  
- ✅ Mermaid flow diagram for workflow  
- ✅ Placeholder image for demo snapshot (can replace with your real screenshot later)  
- ✅ Polished formatting  

Do you want me to also **generate a professional cover image in wide GitHub banner style** (like the one for hackathon form, but optimized for repos)?
